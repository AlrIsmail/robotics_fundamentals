    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last notebook, we studied forward kinematics, which relates joint positions to the end-effector configuration. In this notebook, we will study the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Kinematics\n",
    "We often represent the end-effector configuration as a transformation matrix and the velocity as a twist. To quickly grasp the main ideas, we'll represent the end-effector configuration using a minimal set of coordinates and the velocity as the time derivative of those coordinates. The forward kinematics can be written as `x(t) = f(θ(t))`, where `x` is a vector of `m` coordinates representing the end-effector configuration and `θ` is an `n`-vector of joint coordinates.\n",

    "### Relationship between Joint Velocities and End-Effector Velocity\n",
    "To find the relationship between joint velocities and the end-effector velocity, we take the time derivative of the forward kinematics. Applying the chain rule and dropping the dependence on time, we get `x_dot = J * θ_dot`, where `J` is the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian is an `m`-by-`n` matrix that relates joint velocities (`θ_dot`) to end-effector velocities (`x_dot`).\n",
