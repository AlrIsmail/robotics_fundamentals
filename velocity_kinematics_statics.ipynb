    "We often represent the end-effector configuration as a transformation matrix and the velocity as a twist. To quickly grasp the main ideas, we'll represent the end-effector configuration using a minimal set of coordinates and the velocity as the time derivative of those coordinates. The forward kinematics can be written as `x(t) = f(θ(t))`, where `x` is a vector of `m` coordinates representing the end-effector configuration and `θ` is an `n`-vector of joint coordinates.\n",

    "To find the relationship between joint velocities and the end-effector velocity, we take the time derivative of the forward kinematics.

    "Lastly, the 1R robot has a 2-by-1 full-rank Jacobian at any configuration. However, it is kinematically deficient for achieving arbitrary linear velocities at the tip. It can only achieve linear velocities perpendicular to the link and can only passively resist horizontal forces while actively resisting vertical forces with joint torques.\n"

    "## Manipulability\n",
    "In this section, we explore the manipulability ellipsoid, a visualization tool to understand how close a robot is to being singular. While a robot configuration is either singular or nonsingular, a nonsingular configuration can still be close to being singular. The manipulability ellipsoid allows us to assess this closeness.\n",

    "### Manipulability Ellipsoid for 2R Robot\n",
    "For a 2R robot, a circle of joint velocities maps through the Jacobian to an ellipse of velocities at the end-effector. Depending on the robot's configuration, the ellipse can squash or stretch in different directions, representing the robot's capability to move in certain directions. At the singularity, the ellipse collapses to a line segment.\n",

    "### General Expression for Manipulability Ellipsoid\n",
    "To derive a general expression for the end-effector velocity ellipsoid, we assume the end-effector's velocity is represented as the m-dimensional vector v_tip, and the Jacobian is an m by n matrix. We then define a unit sphere of joint velocities with the equation θ-dotᵀθ-dot = 1 and derive the equation v_tipᵀA⁻¹v_tip = 1, where A = JJᵀ. The matrix A is symmetric and positive definite, allowing us to define an ellipsoid in the vector space of v_tip satisfying the equation.\n",
