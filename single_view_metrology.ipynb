    "In this lecture, we will explore the intriguing world of computer vision, focusing on the concept of recovering three-dimensional (3D) structure from a single 2D image. This process involves leveraging our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of cameras, allowing us to extract valuable information about the 3D world from the 2D perspective captured by the camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by discussing various transformations in 2D space, such as isometric, similarity, affine, and projective transformations. These transformations serve as the mathematical foundation for understanding how points and objects in the 3D world are projected onto a 2D image. By comprehending these transformations, we can better grasp the potential information that can be gleaned from a single image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformations in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isometric Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Isometric transformations are the transformations that preserve distances. The most basic form of an isometry involves a combination of rotation (R) and translation (t). In mathematical terms, an isometric transformation can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [R t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `(x', y', 1)` represents the point achieved after the isometric transformation, where `R` is a rotation matrix and `t` is a translation vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity transformations extend isometric transformations by introducing scaling. These transformations preserve shape, including the ratio of lengths and angles. Mathematically, similarity transformations can be denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [S R t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix `S` represents scaling, which maintains the similarity of shapes. Isometric transformations are a specific case of similarity transformations when the scaling factor `s` is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affine Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Affine transformations preserve points, straight lines, and parallelism. These transformations are represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [A t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `A` is a linear transformation, and `t` is a translation vector. Affine transformations are more general than similarity transformations as they do not require equal scaling in all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projective Transformations (Homographies)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projective transformations, or homographies, are even more general transformations that map lines to lines but do not necessarily preserve parallelism. In homogeneous coordinates, projective transformations are represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [A t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [v b] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 1]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations introduce additional degrees of freedom with the inclusion of the vector `v`. Despite not preserving parallelism, projective transformations maintain collinearity of points, making them suitable for mapping lines to lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the cross ratio of four collinear points remains invariant under projective transformations. The cross ratio is computed as shown above and serves as a useful tool for characterizing projective transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into the application of these transformations and explore how they enable us to recover 3D structure from 2D images, furthering our understanding of the world of computer vision."

    "## Points and Lines at Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the concepts of points and lines at infinity is crucial in the field of computer vision as they play a fundamental role in various transformations and projective geometry. In this section, we will explore the definitions and properties of points and lines at infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2D, a line can be represented using homogeneous coordinates as a vector `l = [a, b, c]ᵀ`. This vector defines the line as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ax + by + c = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `-a/b` captures the slope of the line, and `-c/b` represents the y-intercept. In other words, the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` encode essential information about the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intersection of Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Two lines `l` and `l'` intersect at a point `x`. The intersection point `x` can be defined as the cross product between the vectors `l` and `l'`. Mathematically, if `x = l × l'`, then `x` is orthogonal to both `l` and `l'`, satisfying the intersection constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallel Lines and Points at Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with parallel lines, the conventional understanding is that these lines never intersect. However, in the framework of homogeneous coordinates, we can redefine this scenario as the intersection of lines at infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In homogeneous coordinates, a point at infinity is represented as `[x, y, 0]ᵀ`. To obtain Euclidean coordinates, we divide all coordinates by the last coordinate, which in this case is zero. This division results in a point at infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider two parallel lines `l` and `l'`. In homogeneous coordinates, if we compute the point of intersection using the cross product, we find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "l × l' ∝ [0 0 -1]ᵀ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector `[0 0 -1]ᵀ` corresponds to a point at infinity. Therefore, the intuition that two parallel lines intersect at infinity is confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, all parallel lines with the same slope `-a/b` pass through the same ideal point at infinity. This property is mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lᵀx∞ = [a b c]ᵀ[x, y, 0] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines and Points at Infinity in Projective Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Projective transformations, represented by the matrix `H`, are fundamental in computer vision. When applying a projective transformation to a point at infinity `p∞`, the transformed point `p'` is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p' = Hp∞ = [v b 1]ᵀ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the last element of `p'` may become non-zero, indicating that a projective transformation generally maps points at infinity to points that are no longer at infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the case for affine transformations. Affine transformations, represented by matrices `[A t; 0 1]`, map points at infinity to points that remain at infinity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p' = Hp∞ = [A t; 0 1][x, y, 0]ᵀ = [A t; 0 1][x∞, y∞, 0]ᵀ = [A t; 0 1][0, 0, 0]ᵀ = [0 0 0 1]ᵀ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that affine transformations preserve points at infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the projective transformation of a line `l` to obtain a new line `l'`. In projective geometry, lines are still mapped to lines. The projective transformation is expressed as `l' = H⁻ᵀl`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to points at infinity, the projective transformation of a line at infinity does not necessarily map to another line at infinity. The concept of lines at infinity becomes a valuable tool in computer vision, allowing us to represent parallel lines' intersection points and understand how different transformations affect points and lines in both Euclidean and homogeneous coordinates."
