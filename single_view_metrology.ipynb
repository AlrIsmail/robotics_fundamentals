    "In this lecture, we will explore the intriguing world of computer vision, focusing on the concept of recovering three-dimensional (3D) structure from a single 2D image. This process involves leveraging our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of cameras, allowing us to extract valuable information about the 3D world from the 2D perspective captured by the camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by discussing various transformations in 2D space, such as isometric, similarity, affine, and projective transformations. These transformations serve as the mathematical foundation for understanding how points and objects in the 3D world are projected onto a 2D image. By comprehending these transformations, we can better grasp the potential information that can be gleaned from a single image.\n",

    "## Transformations in 2D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isometric Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Isometric transformations are the transformations that preserve distances. The most basic form of an isometry involves a combination of rotation (R) and translation (t). In mathematical terms, an isometric transformation can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [R t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `(x', y', 1)` represents the point achieved after the isometric transformation, where `R` is a rotation matrix and `t` is a translation vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity transformations extend isometric transformations by introducing scaling. These transformations preserve shape, including the ratio of lengths and angles. Mathematically, similarity transformations can be denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [S R t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix `S` represents scaling, which maintains the similarity of shapes. Isometric transformations are a specific case of similarity transformations when the scaling factor `s` is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affine Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Affine transformations preserve points, straight lines, and parallelism. These transformations are represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [A t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [0 1] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 0]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `A` is a linear transformation, and `t` is a translation vector. Affine transformations are more general than similarity transformations as they do not require equal scaling in all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projective Transformations (Homographies)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projective transformations, or homographies, are even more general transformations that map lines to lines but do not necessarily preserve parallelism. In homogeneous coordinates, projective transformations are represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x']   [A t]   [x]\n",
    "[y'] = [v b] * [y]\n",
    "[1 ]   [0 1]   [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations introduce additional degrees of freedom with the inclusion of the vector `v`. Despite not preserving parallelism, projective transformations maintain collinearity of points, making them suitable for mapping lines to lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the cross ratio of four collinear points remains invariant under projective transformations. The cross ratio is computed as shown above and serves as a useful tool for characterizing projective transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into the application of these transformations and explore how they enable us to recover 3D structure from 2D images, furthering our understanding of the world of computer vision."
