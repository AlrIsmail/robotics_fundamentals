    "### Storing methods\n",
    "This is about how the pixel value is stored. We can select the color space and the data type of the pixel value. The color space refers to how we combine color components to create colors. The simplest color space is the grayscale color space. In this color space, each pixel is represented by a single number. The number represents the intensity of the pixel. The higher the number, the brighter the pixel. The grayscale color space is also called the intensity color space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RGB color space is the most common color space. In this color space, each pixel is represented by three numbers. The three numbers represent the intensity of the red, green and blue components of the pixel. The higher the number, the brighter the component. To code the transparency of a color a fourth component is added. This color space is called RGBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, many other color systems, each with their own advantages:\n",
    "        RGB - Red, Green, Blue (default) : however OpenCV stores them in BGR order\n",
    "        HSV - Hue, Saturation, Value and HLS - Hue, Lightness, Saturation : are more natural way to think about colors, we may discard the value or last component to make more robust to lighting changes\n",
    "        YUV - Luminance, Chrominance : is used in video systems, where Y is the luminance component and U and V are the chrominance components\n",
    "        YCrCb - Luminance, Red Chrominance, Blue Chrominance  : used for JPEG and MPEG images\n",
    "        CIE - L*a*b* - Lightness, Red-Green, Blue-Yellow : is designed to approximate human vision, is perceptually uniform color space, meaning that the difference between two colors is perceptually uniform, which come handy if we need to measure distance given two colors\n",
    "\n",
    "The data type of the pixel value can be unsigned char, signed char, unsigned short, signed short, int, float, double, etc. The data type of the pixel value is specified by the template parameter of the Mat class. Note that increasing the data type will increase the memory required to store the pixel value. \n",
