    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last notebook, we studied forward kinematics, which relates joint positions to the end-effector configuration. In this notebook, we will study the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Kinematics\n",
    "We often represent the end-effector configuration as a transformation matrix and the velocity as a twist. To quickly grasp the main ideas, we'll represent the end-effector configuration using a minimal set of coordinates and the velocity as the time derivative of those coordinates. The forward kinematics can be written as `x(t) = f(θ(t))`, where `x` is a vector of `m` coordinates representing the end-effector configuration and `θ` is an `n`-vector of joint coordinates.\n",

    "### Relationship between Joint Velocities and End-Effector Velocity\n",
    "To find the relationship between joint velocities and the end-effector velocity, we take the time derivative of the forward kinematics. Applying the chain rule and dropping the dependence on time, we get `x_dot = J * θ_dot`, where `J` is the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian is an `m`-by-`n` matrix that relates joint velocities (`θ_dot`) to end-effector velocities (`x_dot`).\n",

The end-effector velocity is a linear combination of `J₁` and `J₂`, with coefficients equal to the joint velocities. `J` is an `m`-by-`n` matrix, where `m` is the number of end-effector coordinates and `n` is the number of joint coordinates.\n",

    "### Singularity\n",
    "When the dimension of the column space of the Jacobian drops from its maximum value, the robot is at a singularity. At a singularity, the robot loses the ability to move in certain directions due to the alignment of `J₁` and `J₂`. This configuration limits the robot's motion and requires careful consideration for force control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Force Analysis using Jacobian\n",
    "The Jacobian also relates forces at the end-effector to forces and torques at the joints. The relationship is given by `τ = Jᵀ(θ) * f_tip`, where `τ` is the vector of joint torques and forces generated by motors, and `f_tip` is the force applied by the end-effector. By mapping joint torque limits through the Jacobian, we can determine the limits on the end-effector force.\n",

    "### Manipulability Ellipsoid\n",
    "Depending on the robot's configuration, the Jacobian can produce different shapes in the end-effector velocity space. The Jacobian can map a circular joint torque limit to an end-effector force ellipsoid, known as the manipulability ellipsoid. The manipulability ellipsoid indicates the robot's ability to apply forces in different directions.\n"
