    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last notebook, we studied forward kinematics, which relates joint positions to the end-effector configuration. In this notebook, we will study the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Kinematics\n",
    "We often represent the end-effector configuration as a transformation matrix and the velocity as a twist. To quickly grasp the main ideas, we'll represent the end-effector configuration using a minimal set of coordinates and the velocity as the time derivative of those coordinates. The forward kinematics can be written as `x(t) = f(θ(t))`, where `x` is a vector of `m` coordinates representing the end-effector configuration and `θ` is an `n`-vector of joint coordinates.\n",

    "### Relationship between Joint Velocities and End-Effector Velocity\n",
    "To find the relationship between joint velocities and the end-effector velocity, we take the time derivative of the forward kinematics. Applying the chain rule and dropping the dependence on time, we get `x_dot = J * θ_dot`, where `J` is the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian is an `m`-by-`n` matrix that relates joint velocities (`θ_dot`) to end-effector velocities (`x_dot`).\n",

    "The Jacobian also relates forces at the end-effector to forces and torques at the joints. The relationship is given by `τ = Jᵀ(θ) * f_tip`, where `τ` is the vector of joint torques and forces generated by motors, and `f_tip` is the force applied by the end-effector. By mapping joint torque limits through the Jacobian, we can determine the limits on the end-effector force.\n",

    "We will focus on the third column of the space Jacobian, denoted as J_s3, which corresponds to the spatial twist when the velocity at joint 3 is 1, and the velocity at all other joints is zero. If all joint angles are zero, then J_s3 is simply the screw axis S3 of joint 3 when the arm is at its zero configuration. However, we need to find the twist corresponding to a unit velocity at joint 3 in an arbitrary configuration, not just at the zero configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing Joint Movements\n",
    "To find the column J_s3, we will move the robot's joints and observe how it affects J_s3. First, we rotate joint 5, and J_s3 remains unaffected as joint 5 is not between joint 3 and the {s} frame. Similarly, when we rotate joint 3 and 4, J_s3 remains unaffected as these joints are also not between joint 3 and the {s} frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing New Frames\n",
    "Now, when we rotate joint 2, J_s3 changes. To understand why, we will introduce a new frame {s-prime} that is attached to joint 2. The {s-prime} frame is located at the origin of the {s} frame, and its x-axis is aligned with the x-axis of the {s} frame. The y-axis of the {s-prime} frame is parallel to the y-axis of the {s} frame, and the z-axis of the {s-prime} frame is parallel to the z-axis of the {s} frame. The {s-prime} frame is rotated by θ_2 about the z-axis of the {s} frame. \n",

    "The same reasoning applies for any joint, not just joint 3 of this 5R robot. Joint positions of joints between the joint and the {s} frame must be taken into account, while joint positions that do not affect the relationship between the joint and the {s} frame can be ignored.\n",
