    "# Structure from Motion Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional stereo vision, the primary objective is to estimate the 3D location of a point (P) using corresponding points (p and p') from two images through triangulation. However, a significant challenge arises: how can we determine if a point in one image corresponds to a point in another? This challenge becomes more complex when dealing with numerous 3D points within a scene. This document explores alternative techniques for robust 3D reconstruction.\n",

    "## Active Stereo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Active Stereo Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Active stereo offers a solution to the correspondence problem in traditional stereo vision. It replaces one of the cameras with a device that interacts with the 3D environment, typically by projecting a pattern onto the object. This projector-camera pair defines an epipolar geometry similar to standard stereo. By projecting a point (p) onto the object's 3D space, we can observe it as point (p') in the second camera. Since we control the projection's parameters, we can easily identify corresponding points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Projector-Camera Setup:** The projector is used to project a point or line onto the object in 3D space, resulting in a 3D point or line. This 3D point or line should be observed in the second camera as a corresponding point or line. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stripe Projection:** In many active stereo setups, a vertical stripe is projected onto the object, and the corresponding stripe is observed in the camera. This allows for easy correspondence matching by intersecting the stripe with epipolar lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calibration:** Calibration is crucial in active stereo setups to ensure accurate results. It involves calibrating both the camera and the projector using known patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Approaches:** In some cases, simpler and less expensive methods, such as shadow-based techniques, can be used to project patterns onto objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Vertical Stripes\n",
    "\n",
    "In active stereo, it's common to project vertical stripes onto the object. This approach is similar to the point case, but a vertical line (s) in the virtual plane projects to a stripe in 3D space (S) and appears as a line (s') in the camera. If the projector and camera are parallel, we can find corresponding points by intersecting s' with horizontal epipolar lines. This allows us to reconstruct the 3D points on the stripe. Repeating this process while sweeping the stripe across the scene helps reconstruct the entire shape of visible objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration is essential for active stereo. You can calibrate the system by following techniques described in previous notes. Calibration ensures accurate results. For example, in 2000, researchers at Stanford used a well-calibrated setup to accurately reconstruct Michelangelo's Pieta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost-Efficient Alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where a finely tuned projector is impractical, a cost-effective alternative utilizes shadows to project patterns. By placing an object between the light source and the object, you can project shadows onto the object and recover it in a similar manner. This approach is less accurate due to calibration requirements and tradeoffs between shadow length and thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Colored Stripes\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up the process and capture real-time deformations, a variant projects a known pattern of colored stripes onto the entire object. These colored stripes can be uniquely identified in the images. This technique has powered depth sensors like the Microsoft Kinect, which use infrared laser projectors for 3D data capture under various lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Volumetric Stereo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volumetric Stereo Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumetric stereo takes a different approach from traditional and active stereo. It assumes that the 3D point to be estimated is within a known, confined volume. The technique projects the hypothesized 3D point into calibrated cameras and validates the consistency of these projections across multiple views.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Hull:** Volumetric stereo methods aim to find the \"visual hull\" of the object, which is the intersection of visual cones from each camera view.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency Checks:** Volumetric stereo relies on consistency checks across multiple views to validate the estimated 3D points. Three major techniques for these checks are Space Carving, Shadow Carving, and Voxel Coloring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Carving\n",
    "\n",
    "Space carving utilizes object contours as a source of geometric information. Silhouettes of objects from multiple views are used to enforce consistency. The method involves defining a working volume, dividing it into voxels, and projecting these voxels into each view. Voxels not contained by silhouettes are discarded, leaving those within the visual hull. Space carving scales with the number of voxels but has limitations in handling concavities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Silhouettes:** Silhouettes are contours of objects in images, and they provide geometric information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Working Volume:** Define a working volume that encloses the object. Divide it into voxels (3D pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency Check:** For each voxel, project it into each view. If it's not part of the silhouette in a view, discard it. The remaining voxels define the visual hull.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:** Scaling with voxel resolution and difficulty handling certain concavities are limitations of space carving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shadow Carving\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadow carving addresses concavity issues by using self-shadows. An array of lights surrounding the camera is used to make the object cast self-shadows. The process is similar to space carving but incorporates self-shadow information to estimate concavities. However, shadow carving's runtime increases with the number of lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Light Sources:** An array of lights surrounds the object, casting self-shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency Check:** Turn on and off lights, detecting self-shadows in each view. Eliminate voxels in concavities based on these shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Shadow carving provides more accurate results for concave objects but is sensitive to the number of views and lights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voxel Coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "Voxel coloring uses color consistency instead of contour consistency. It compares the color of projections from multiple views for each voxel and marks it as part of the object if colors match. However, it assumes Lambertian surfaces and requires careful voxel processing order to avoid ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Consistency Check:** Compare the colors of corresponding voxel projections from different views.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lambertian Assumption:** Assumes objects are Lambertian, meaning the color remains consistent with changing viewpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orderly Processing:** To resolve ambiguities, voxels are processed layer by layer, ensuring visibility constraints are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Voxel coloring captures both shape and texture but assumes Lambertian surfaces and a specific order of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques provide varying trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and computational cost in 3D reconstruction from multiple images.\n"
