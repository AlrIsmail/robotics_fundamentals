    "# Dynamics of Open-Chain Robots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In Chapter 8, we delve into the dynamics of open-chain robots. Dynamics plays a pivotal role in simulating robot behavior and controlling their movements. This chapter explores two approaches to solving the forward and inverse dynamics problems: the Lagrangian formulation and the Newton-Euler formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Dynamics\n",
    "The forward dynamics problem involves calculating joint accelerations $\\ddot{\\theta}$ based on current joint positions $\\theta$, joint velocities $\\dot{\\theta}$, and applied forces and torques $\\tau$ at each joint. This information is valuable for robot simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Dynamics\n",
    "Conversely, the inverse dynamics problem entails finding the joint forces and torques $\\tau$ required to produce a given acceleration $\\ddot{\\theta}$ for specified joint positions $\\theta$ and velocities $\\dot{\\theta}$. This is crucial for robot control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Robot Dynamics\n",
    "Robot dynamics are not only essential for simulation and control but also for the analysis of motion planners and controllers. This foundation paves the way for more advanced topics.\n"

    "## Lagrangian Formulation of Dynamics\n",
    "The Lagrangian formulation is a conceptually simple approach to robot dynamics. It relies on the Lagrangian $L$, which is the difference between kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $P$ of a mechanical system. The Lagrangian equations of motion yield joint forces and torques $\\tau$ as the time derivative of $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta}$. The power consumed or produced by the joints can be represented as $\\tau \\cdot \\dot{\\theta}$.\n",

    "For a 2R robot in gravity, where the lengths of links are $L_1$ and $L_2$, kinetic energy is calculated for point masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. The Lagrangian involves calculating the kinetic and potential energies for each point mass, leading to expressions that contribute to the joint torques.\n",
