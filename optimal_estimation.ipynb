    "# State Estimation and Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "State estimation is a crucial task for artificial agents to make informed decisions in real-time. In this process, we aim to determine the current state of a system using data from various sensors. We will explore state estimation, focusing on the Kalman filter, in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to State Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "State estimation involves inferring the hidden or latent state of a system based on sensor measurements and control inputs. This is essential for various applications like robotics, where an agent needs to know its position, velocity, and orientation in an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In state estimation, we use probabilistic models to represent the uncertainty in both the state and measurements. The key idea is to compute the posterior probability distribution of the state given all available data, including historical measurements and control inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilistic Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) using graphical models. In this model:\n",
    "- `xt` is the state at time `t`.\n",
    "- `zt` is a sensor observation at time `t`.\n",
    "- `ut` is the control input applied at time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements like camera images or Lidar data depend on the state of the system. We treat `xt` and `zt` as random variables with probability distributions `p(xt)` and `p(zt)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of state estimation is to compute or approximate the posterior distribution of the state at the current time step. We want to find `p(xt|z1:t, u1:t)`, which represents the probability of the state given the sequence of measurements and control inputs. This posterior is also known as the belief about the state's value at time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key assumptions are made:\n",
    "1. Markovian Property: The system's current state `xt` only depends on the previous state `xt−1` and the previous control input `ut−1`. This is represented by the transition model `p(xt|xt−1, ut)`.\n",
    "2. Measurement Independence: The current measurement `zt` only depends on the current state `xt`, i.e., `p(zt|xt)`. This assumption ensures that `zt` is conditionally independent of all previous states, measurements, and control inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bayes Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes filter is a recursive method for state estimation that continuously updates the state posterior as new measurements arrive. It consists of two main steps: prediction and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Step\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prediction step, we use the transition model `p(xt|xt−1, ut)` and the previous posterior `bel(t-1)` to predict the state posterior at time `t`. The complexity of this step remains constant over time, making it suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update Step\n",
    "\n",
    "In the update step, we refine the predicted posterior using the new measurement `zt`. We compute a Kalman Gain `Kt` to weigh the influence of the predicted measurement and the actual measurement. The update step combines both sources of information to improve the state estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter is a specific implementation of the Bayes filter tailored for linear-Gaussian systems. It assumes that all random variables are Gaussian and that the process and measurement models are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kalman filter, Gaussian distributions play a central role. A Gaussian distribution is defined by its mean `μ` and covariance `Σ`. The covariance matrix `Σ` represents the spread and correlation of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kalman Filter Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction Step**: Predict the mean and covariance of the state posterior using the process model.\n",
    "   - `μt|t−1 = At * μt−1|t−1 + Bt * ut`\n",
    "   - `Σt|t−1 = At * Σt−1|t−1 * At^T + Qt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Step**: Refine the predicted state with the new measurement.\n",
    "   - Calculate the Kalman Gain `Kt`.\n",
    "     - `Kt = Σt|t−1 * Ct^T * (Ct * Σt|t−1 * Ct^T + Rt)^(-1)`\n",
    "   - Update the mean and covariance.\n",
    "     - `μt|t = μt|t−1 + Kt * (zt - Ct * μt|t−1)`\n",
    "     - `Σt|t = (I - Kt * Ct) * Σt|t−1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter is limited to linear-Gaussian systems. When dealing with non-linear dynamics or measurement functions, we use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF linearizes these functions at each time step to apply the Kalman filter equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EKF follows the same prediction and update steps as the Kalman filter but uses Jacobian matrices to approximate the linearization of non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, state estimation is a fundamental concept for autonomous systems, and the Kalman filter, along with its extension, the EKF, is a powerful tool for handling state estimation in various applications.\n"
