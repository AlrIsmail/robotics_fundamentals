    "# Kinematics and Statics of Closed-Chain Robots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In previous notebooks, we explored the forward kinematics, velocity kinematics, statics, and inverse kinematics of open-chain robots. Now, we delve into these topics for closed-chain robots, although in a more concise manner. Closed-chain robot kinematics and statics can be more intricate due to the diverse design possibilities and loop-closure equations. This notebook provides an example-based overview of these complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "Let's begin by examining some examples of closed-chain robots:\n",
    "1. A 4-degree-of-freedom robot arm with x, y, z motion and vertical rotation. Though it resembles an open-chain robot, it qualifies as closed-chain due to its parallelogram linkage.\n",
    "2. A 4-degree-of-freedom Delta robot with x, y, z motion and vertical rotation. Variations of this robot also eliminate rotational motion.\n",
    "3. The Stewart platform, a 6-degree-of-freedom mechanism with prismatic joints. Each leg has a spherical joint at one end and a spherical/universal joint at the other. This platform finds applications in aircraft simulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics\n",
    "Parallel robots, like the Delta robot and Stewart platform, are a subset of closed-chain robots, where the end-effector is connected to the base by multiple kinematic chains. These robots are often designed to be stiff and strong, with high accuracy and speed. However, they may have a smaller workspace than open-chain robots due to leg constraints. Additionally, parallel robots may have fewer actuators than open-chain robots, as some joints may be unactuated. \n",
    "Let's summarize some distinguishing characteristics of open-chain and parallel robots:\n",
    "- Open-chain robots usually have a motor for each joint, while many joints in parallel robots remain unactuated.\n",
    "- Open-chain robots often possess a larger workspace, whereas parallel robots typically have a smaller workspace due to leg constraints.\n",
    "- Open-chain robots may be relatively weak, while parallel robots tend to be stiffer and stronger as forces distribute among legs.\n",
    "- Forward kinematics is relatively straightforward using the product of exponentials for open-chain robots, but multiple solutions can exist for parallel robots.\n",
    "- Inverse kinematics for parallel robots can sometimes be more straightforward, but both open-chain and parallel robots may require numerical methods for solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverse Kinematics and Velocity Kinematics\n",
    "Inverse kinematics for closed-chain robots can be simpler for specific cases. For instance, in the Stewart platform, the prismatic joint value can be calculated using vector transformations in homogeneous coordinates. For more complex cases with legs as open chains, solving inverse kinematics may involve multiple leg solutions.\n",

    "Inverse velocity kinematics for closed-chain robots can be addressed using screw axes. By defining screw axes in the {s}-frame, the joint velocities can be calculated based on the spatial twist V_s and screw axis V_i.\n",

    "\\dot{\\theta} = J_s^{-1}(\\theta)V_s\n",

    "Let v-hat_i be the unit 3 vector aligned with the direction of positive motion of joint i. Then, the screw axis V_i can be defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_i(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{is} \\times \\hat{v}_i(\\theta) \\\\ \\hat{v}_i(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}\n",

    "Then the joint velocity can be calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{\\theta} = V_i(\\theta) \\cdot V_s = V_i^T(\\theta) V_s\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Repeating this process for all joints, we can write the i-th column of inverse of the Jacobian as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{\\theta} = J_s^{-1}(\\theta)V_s\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where n is the number of joints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Singularities\n",
    "Closed-chain robots introduce various singularities not seen in open-chain counterparts. For instance, the 3-by-RPR parallel mechanism exhibits singularities where the constraint Jacobian loses rank. These singularities can impact the robot's behavior and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $J_s^{-1}$ is invertible:\n",
    "Velocity kinematics and statics are\n",

    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = J_s^T(\\theta)F_s\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $F_s$ is the spatial force applied to the end-effector. If $J_s^{-1}$ is not invertible, then the robot is in a singular configuration. In this case, the robot may not be able to move in certain directions, and the forces may not be able to move the robot in certain directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Kinematics\n",
    "The forward kinematics problem in closed-chain robots often involves solving nonlinear equations, potentially leading to multiple solutions. The 3-by-RPR robot can have up to 6 possible end-effector configurations given joint extensions, while the 6-dof Stewart platform may have up to 40 solutions. Iterative numerical methods, similar to Newton-Raphson, are commonly used for solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta = T_{sb}(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Closed-chain robots are a subset of robots with multiple kinematic chains connecting the end-effector to the base. These robots can be more complex than open-chain robots, with more intricate kinematics and statics. However, they can also be more robust, stiff, and strong, with high accuracy and speed. Inverse kinematics and forward kinematics can be more challenging for closed-chain robots, as they may involve solving nonlinear equations with multiple solutions. Singularities can also be more complex, as they may involve multiple legs. Overall, closed-chain robots are a fascinating subset of robots with many applications.\n"
