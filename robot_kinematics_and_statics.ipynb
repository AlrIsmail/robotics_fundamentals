    "# Forward Kinematics of Open-Chain Robots\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the forward kinematics of open-chain robots. Open-chain robots consist of serially connected links and joints, allowing them to move in a sequence of joints. The goal is to find the configuration of the end-effector frame {b} relative to the base frame {s} given the vector of joint angles, denoted as θ.\n",

    "The transformation matrix T_sb(θ), or simply T(θ), represents the {b}-frame in the {s}-frame. It describes how the end-effector moves relative to the base as the joint angles change.\n",

    "### Example: Simple Robot Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the procedure for calculating T(θ), let's consider a simple robot arm that moves in a plane. The robot arm has three joints: a revolute joint, a prismatic joint, and another revolute joint. The joint variables are represented as θ₁, θ₂, and θ₃.  \n",
