This repository contains the code and personal notes based on the Robotics Fundamentals book and course "Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park. I don't own any of the material, I just want to share my personal notes and code while I learn about robotics fundamentals.
## Overview of the repository
### foundation of robotics motions
We will learn about the following topics:
- [ ] Degrees of freedom of a rigid body
- [ ] Degrees of freedom of a robot
- [ ] Configuration space Topology
- [ ] Configuration and Velocity Constraints
- [ ] Taskspace and Workspace

### introduction to rigid body motions
We will learn about the following topics:
- [ ] Rotation matrices
- [ ] Angular velocity
- [ ] Exponential coordinates
